					<description><![CDATA[I am having issues in getting ruby on rails welcome aboard page to appear in my browser. my dns nameserver is virtualmachine2.khufunet.com. I am creating this environment on vmware. when I use dns lookup it works fine but i am concerned that my settings in the virtualhost file for my test app is conflicting with my nameserver. it is virtualmachine2.khufunet.com not www.khufunet.com What settings should i have for the ServerName and ServerAlias. I tried ServerName www.khufunet.com and virtualmachine2.khufunet.com but neither seem to be working. I cannot figure out how to resolve this. Please bare in mind if i use the ip address of the dns server it shows the welcome page to apache. I am doing this project with 4 services on the one virtual machine, ssh server, cups server, dns server and ruby on rails server. any tips or suggestions would be much appreciated. I am a new linux user.]]></description>
