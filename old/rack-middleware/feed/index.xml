					<description><![CDATA[Hello Anjana, I know this is outside the scope of the article but by chance do you know how to create a middleware while using rails 5 in api-mode?

This post shows how to do it in rails 4:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26922343/omniauthnosessionerror-you-must-provide-a-session-to-use-omniauth-configur

I&#039;m trying to create a middleware like the accepted answer in the above post but when adding the
config.middleware.insert_before ActionDispatch::ParamsParser, &quot;SelectiveStack&quot;
it throws an error saying it can&#039;t find SelectiveStack.

It also won&#039;t let me add a require or includes in the application.rb to access it, so I was wondering if you&#039;ve come across this or had any ideas?]]></description>
