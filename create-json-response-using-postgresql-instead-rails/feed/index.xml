					<description><![CDATA[I cant remember what version of postgres we were using. It might have been an older one. We just moved the json generation back to the app servers. It works there. The database was probably about the same order of magnitude number of records. I would just recommend monitoring the database memory usage. It is possible there was some bug that we ran into that has since been fixed or there was something pathological about our queries. I did not really investigate too deeply since we were just testing it out. It was easy for us to switch back and we had a lot of higher priority stuff we needed to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any idea regarding it. We are using Postgres 9.5 with JSON generation in a table with presently half a million record and growing per day. The query runs in a small subset of the table after joining with other tables, but we have found no spike in memory compare to the spike we see while doing it in rails.

Also what did you do instead. Did you find another suitable/efficient solution for your problem.]]></description>
