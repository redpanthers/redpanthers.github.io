<h3>The story so far</h3>


Ever since its advent in 2007, <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree">Spree</a> &#8211; originally developed by Sean Schofield, is the most popular open source Ruby On Rails E-commerce Software spanning over 17,703 commits, 725 contributes and 208 releases. Spree was acquired by <a href="https://spreecommerce.com/blog/spree-acquired-by-first-data">First Data</a> in the late 2015 and since then, there has been fair amount of speculation around Spree remaining as an opensource project and it&#8217;s long term future as outlined here in this <a href="https://spreecommerce.com/blog/future-of-spree-oss">blog post</a>.
As it turned out Spree didn&#8217;t die off, but revived under a new <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/wiki/Core-Team">core team</a>. After the acquisition announcement developers from <a href="https://sparksolutions.co/">Spark Solutions </a>and <a href="http://vinsol.com/">Vinsol</a> volunteered to keep spree alive and has been doing a fantastic job, putting shoulders to the wheel by taking Spree from version <code>3.0.4</code> to the current <code>Spree 3.3</code>


<h3>Whats new in Spree 3.3</h3>


On August 22, 2017, Spree released version 3.3 and is packed with the following major features.


<h5>Rails 5.1 support</h5>


<code>Spree 3.3</code> is <code>Rails 5.1</code>  compatible whereas <code>Spree 3.2</code>  runs on Rails version <code>5.0</code>. Which means managing JavaScript dependencies from NPM via `Yarn`, ability to use <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html#direct-resolved-routes">direct &amp; resolved routes</a>, <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html#parameterized-mailers">parameterized mailers</a> and many more goodies `Rails 5.1`  has to offer


<h5>Ruby 2.4 support</h5>


Spree now works with Ruby versions `2.2 (&gt;= 2.2.7)` , <code>2.2 (&gt;= 2.2.7)</code> , <code>2.2 (&gt;= 2.2.7)</code> ,  <code>2.3.x</code>  and the latest <code>2.4.x</code>. So <code>Ruby 2.4x</code> ?  Yay! that&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.redpanthers.co/behind-scenes-hash-table-performance-ruby-2-4/">Faster Hashes</a>, <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/ruby-2-4-features-hashes-integers-rounding">Unified Integers, and Better Rounding</a> for you right out of the box


<h5>Segment tracker integration</h5>


<code>Spree 3.3</code> is bundled with <a href="https://segment.com/">segment.com</a> Tracker system which enables you to
connect your store with over 200 analytics engines, CRMs, live chats, remarketing platforms and much more without any additional development. If that&#8217;s not cool enough for you stay tuned for next releases for more third party tracker and analytics integrations.


<h5>Bug fixes and performance enhancements</h5>


&#8211; Unique indexes and uniqueness validation on number fields for important models
&#8211; Multiple regular &amp; unique indexes that were missing have been added to improve data consistency and performance
&#8211; Optimized Shipments and Inventory Units.
&#8211; Better Store Credits management in customer Frontend and Admin Panel


<h3>Whats next?</h3>


Spree development has been slowly gaining traction recently.
<a href="https://blog.redpanthers.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-26-at-21.53.16.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3344" src="https://blog.redpanthers.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-26-at-21.53.16.png" alt="" width="979" height="180" /></a>
The future roadmap for spree development can be found <a href="https://github.com/spree/spree/milestones?direction=asc&amp;sort=due_date&amp;state=open">here</a>. But still, it is fair to say that more focus and a unified effort is necessary for the long term survival of Spree. Let&#8217;s join the folks at Spark solutions and Vinsol and start contributing to Spree OSS project]]&gt;		</p>
