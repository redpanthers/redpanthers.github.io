<h2>Fort Cochin</h2>

Apart from the above places, there is numerous mouth-watering variety of food you should try out to tickle your taste buds in Cochin.
If you are a foodie then Cochin ought to be on your bucket list, it&#8217;s an exhaustive list but we would try to skim down the list and give you a variety of food joints to choose from.


<ul>
 	

<li>


<h2><strong><strong><strong>Grand Pavilion, Ernakulam</strong></strong></strong></h2>


The Grand hotel Pavilion is one of Kochi&#8217;s oldest and most popular restaurants. The restaurant is part of the Grand Hotel which started in 1963 offering lodging and food. But it’s the restaurant which has become the landmark, and not without reason. The Grand is famous for its Syrian (Christian) food and the Karimeen Pollicahthu (fried pear spot fish) here is a highlight. So is the seafood and the Biryani (a rice dish made of herbs, spices, and meat).It can be very crowded during lunch hours (not surprising, given its popularity) but if you are looking for true Keralan delicacies at fantastic value, then Grand is the place to be.

<h2>Kayyikka Restaurant</h2>


Whilst Kochi mostly attracts international attention for its outstanding seafood, the humble biryani is also worthy of note, being one of the city’s defining culinary characteristics. Although officially entitled the <a class="external" href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g297633-d2227230-Reviews-Kayees_Rahmathullah_Hotel_Restaurant-Kochi_Cochin_Kerala.html">Rahmuthalla Hotel</a>, Kochi locals popularly refer to this space as Kayikka’s, after the man who first discovered and honed the original biryani recipe in the same spot. Kayikka’s has cultivated a cult following, each enjoying the deliciously sumptuous richness of a dish cooked in copious amounts of pure <em>ghee,</em> or clarified butter. Whether it’s for the evergreen chicken and mutton biryani or the fish and prawn biryani served with date pickle, Kayikka’s loyal fan-base can always be found frequenting this popular haunt.

<h2>The Rice Boat &#8211; Vivanta</h2>


Whilst in Kerala, do what the locals do. If abiding by this mantra, sampling seafood is top of the list. The <a class="external" href="http://www.vivantabytaj.com/malabar-cochin/dining/the-rice-boat-restaurant.html">Vivanta</a> is housed on a stationary ‘kettuvalam’ or rice boat and boasts the juiciest seafood in Kerala. The fresh daily catch is enhanced by the spectacular waterfront view of Fort Cochin, complementing the rustic décor aboard the boat. The signature dishes such as tiger prawns in coconut oil, white snapper in banana leaf and soft-shelled crab with tartar sauce comes to life with the flavor of local spices, especially the fragrant turmeric and coconut. The restaurant also caters to the pared-down palette of the visiting Westerner, serving lobster bisque, crab au gratin, and crepe Suzette.

<h2><strong>History Restaurant &#8211; The Brunton Boatyard Hotel</strong></h2>


Located in the <a href="http://www.cghearth.com/brunton-boatyard">Brunton Boatyard Hotel,</a> History Restaurant is an ingenious concept in stylish travel. The food is exquisite. The menu here offers a wide range of options tracing Cochin’s Jewish, Syrian, Arabic and Portuguese history. These cuisines have been enriched with recipes borrowed from the kitchens of Kochi families. For the main course, one can have the ‘Fisherman’s, Stew’, a Portuguese favourite of mixed seafood cooked with kidney beans, herbs and fresh ground pepper; the ‘Kariveppila Kozhy’ which has chicken cooked in Kerala spices with coconut; and the Curry Leaf and ‘Byculla Club Curry’, a dish from the British era which consists of cottage cheese dumplings stuffed with banana and served with a velvety green sauce. The hotel is located in the heart of Fort Cochin but is easily reachable from the main town as well.
