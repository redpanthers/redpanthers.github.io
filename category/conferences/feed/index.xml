								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We (the team) at Red Panthers were happy to sponsor a student, Neethu Sajeevan from Cochin University, to attend RubyConf India this year. We hope to support more students in the coming years. You can find the article she wrote about her experience re-blogged below.</p>
<p>Re-Blogged from:</p>
<blockquote><p>I attended the RubyConf India Conference that took place from 19th March to the 20th March 2016 at the Le Meridien Kochi in Kochi, India.I express my heart-felt-gratitude to Red Panthers /, the digital sponsor for RubyConf India2016 who sponsored my ticket. Attending the conference was a very valuable and engaging experience for me, to hear from passionate and creative people speak about their work.<br />
The conference covered areas like Ruby Language, Framework and Tools and well known speakers from international Ruby community. We (Anila Anne George and me myself ) thank our sponsors for giving us this great opportunity. As students this was the first professional conference that we attended.</p></blockquote>
